| Allows you to create a clean and simple look by using pre-defined utility classes that can be put together to make a website.                        | Comes with a lot of pre-defined styles and layout modules that you may not need for a minimalist website.                                         |

#Why React ?
***
React is a JavaScript library that can be a good choice for building a website, especially if you want a highly interactive and dynamic website. It allows you to build your website as a collection of reusable components, it has a virtual DOM for performance optimization, it is flexible, scalable, and widely adopted.
Compared to other frameworks, React is particularly well suited for building complex and highly interactive user interfaces. Other frameworks such as Angular and Vue.js also provide reusable components, however, React's implementation of the virtual DOM and its focus on the component-based architecture make it particularly well-suited for building large, complex applications with changing data.

<!-- Please keep in mind that GitHub markdown uses --- to create horizontal lines as well, but it's used for creating tables and it's not recommended to use it as a separator between sections. -->
